Performance Optimisations for Stereoscopic and Multiscopic Rendering

This is the Unity Project version of the artefact for my MSc (Res) thesis artefact. 
You can find more information regarding the project here: grigtod.com

This project consists of three different performance optimisations:
- Foveated Rendering
- Dynamic Resolution
- Depth Reuse

Each optimisation is implemented for:
- Traditional (2D) rendering
- Stereoscopy (Interlaced) 
- Multiscopy (Alioscopy)

A video tutorial, more information and the thesis will be published on my website soon.
If you would like to try the rendering optimisations you can find prefabs for the cameras in "Assets\_RenderingOptimisations\Prefabs".
In order to add a performance optimisation to the scene you need to drag and drop any of the cameras.
